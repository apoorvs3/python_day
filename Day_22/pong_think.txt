me_thinking:

1. Screen size of (3 x 1)
2. 2 (3 segment) Turtles which can go up and down. Since we are player and opponent at same time, use w/s for left and arrow up and down for right
3. Drawing a turtle border in b/w
4. 2 score boards next to border line
5. Bouncing turtle which "heading" turns 180 degree if strikes up and down of screen or paddle
6. If bouncing turtle strikes paddle score increases else if strikes sides of screen score remains same



yuuu:

1. create the screen
2. create and move a paddle
3. create another paddle
4. create the ball and make it move
5. detect collision with ball and bounce
6. Detect collision with paddle
7. detect when paddle misses
8. Keep score
